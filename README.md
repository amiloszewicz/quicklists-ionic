# quicklists
## A real world CRUD application.

### This application covers similar concepts to what a traditional todo application would. Specifically, the main concepts are:
- Complex Lists
- Data Types / Interfaces
- Forms and User Input
- Simple Navigation
- Passing Data Between Pages
- Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting Data
- Data Storage and Retrieval
- Theme and Styling

### Here's a quick rundown of the exact features of the application:
- The user can create any number of checklists
- The user can add any number of individual items to any checklist
- An item in a checklist can be marked as complete or incomplete
- The user can edit or delete any checklist or items in a checklist
- The user can "reset" the completion state of an entire checklist with one action
- All data will be remembered upon returning to the application (including the completion state of checklist items)
